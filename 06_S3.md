## S3 Use Cases

- Archiving, backup and storage
- Static websites
- Application hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Disaster Recovery
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Media hosting
- Software delivery

## S3 Important Points

- **Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)**
- **Buckets must have a globally unique name** (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the **region** level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region

## Object Storage: Important Points

- Accessing Objects:
    - **Objects are accessed via URL**
    - Objects (files) have a Key
    - **The key is the FULL path:**
        - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
        - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- Object values are the content of the body:
    - **Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)**
    - **If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”**

## S3 Storage Classes

- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
- Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA)
- Amazon S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

- **It is possible to move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations**
- Summarized types of Storage Classes:
    - Standard
    - Infrequent Access
    - Glacier

# STANDARD CLASSES

## Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose

- **Used for frequently accessed data**
- **Low latency** and delivers a lot of content quickly and at once
- Use Cases: **Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution**…
- 99.99% Availability
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures

## Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access **(S3 Standard-IA)**

- For **data that is less frequently accessed**, but **requires rapid access when needed**
- **Lower cost than S3 Standard**
- Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups

# ONE-ZONE / INFREQUENT ACCESS

## Amazon S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access **(S3 One Zone-IA)**

- Single AZ, data is lost when AZ is destroyed
- High durability
- 99.5% availability
- **Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate**

# S3 GLACIER

- Low-cost object storage meant for **archiving / backup**
- **Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost**

## **Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**

- **Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter**
- **Minimum storage duration of 90 days**

## **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier)**

- Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) – free
- Minimum storage duration of 90 days

## **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive - for long term storage**

- Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
- Minimum storage duration of 180 days

## **S3 Object Lock & Glacier Vault Lock**

- **S3 Object Lock**
    - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
    - Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- **Glacier Vault Lock**
    - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
    - Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed)
    - Helpful for compliance and data retention

## **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
- There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
- Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
- Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
- Deep Archive Access tier (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days

## S3 Snow Family

Set of PHYSICAL devices and services provided by AWS to **transfer large amounts of data between on-premises environments and the AWS Cloud**.

### **How Does It Work?**

1. You request the device (Snowcone, Snowball, or Snowmobile) from AWS.
2. Copy your data to the device using standard storage protocols.
3. Ship the device back to AWS, where your data is transferred to AWS storage services like S3.
4. Once the process is complete, the data on the device is securely wiped.

### **Snow Family services:**

- **AWS Snowcone:**
    - **Smallest device in the family.**
    - Stores up to 8 TB of data.
    - Portable and ideal for remote or low-infrastructure environments.
- **AWS Snowball:**
    - Available in two versions:
        - **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized**: For massive data transfers with up to **80 TB** of capacity.
        - **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized**: Offers additional compute capacity for processing data locally.
    - Rugged and suitable for large-scale data migrations or field operations.
- **AWS Snowmobile**:
    - **Data transfer truck**.
    - Used to migrate **exabytes** of data (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes).
    - Ideal for moving entire data centers to AWS.

### Snow Family use cases:

- Transfer large volumes of data to the cloud without relying on internet connections.
- Locations with poor connectivity, such as ships, factories, or rural areas.
- Devices like Snowball Edge Compute allow processing data locally before sending it to the cloud.
- Quickly transfer backups to the cloud after an incident.

### **Why Use the Snow Family?**

- Much faster than transferring large datasets over the internet.
- Reduces data transfer costs, especially in low-connectivity areas.
- Data is encrypted on the device during transit.

## Edge Computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it’s needed, rather than relying on a centralized data center.

### Examples:

- Smart devices analyzing data locally (e.g., autonomous cars processing sensor data in real-time).
- Retail stores using local servers for quick transaction processing.
- Remote oil rigs monitoring equipment and alerting only critical updates to the cloud.

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the www
- The website URL will be:
    - bucket-name.s3-website-AWS-region.amazonaws.com OR
    - bucket-name.s3-website.AWS-region.amazonaws.com
- If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads

## S3 Security

- **User based**
    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- **Resource Based**
    - **Bucket Policies** - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
- **Note:** an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
    - the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
    - AND there’s no explicit DENY
- **Encryption:** encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Shared Responsibility

### AWS:

- Infrastructure
- Configuration and vulnerability analysis
- Compliance validation

### Customer:

- S3 Versioning, S3 Bucket Policies, S3 Replication Setup
- Logging and Monitoring, S3 Storage Classes
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## **AWS Storage Gateway**

- **Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3**
- Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage

### AWS Storage Gateway - TYPES:

- **File Gateway:** Stores files locally and transfers them to S3 as objects
- **Volume Gateway:** Provides block storage to local apps and does backeup for them on S3
- **Tape Gateway:** Virtual Tape Library (VTL) System. Allows you to substitute your physical tape library for a virtual one. This allows your apps to have backups on AWS that you made and stored in physical form previously
