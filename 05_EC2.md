## EC2 – Definition

- **Elastic Compute Cloud**
- Cloud computing **service** that offers scalable virtual servers in AWS.

## Use-Cases

- Hosting applications
- Executing jobs (like calculations or data processing)
- Managing development and testing environments.

## Things that can/need to be set-up:

- OS
- Instance specs (CPU, ram, storage, etc)
- Region and availability
- Instance type (based on necessity of the use-case)
- **Networking**: Configuring VPCs, subnets, and security groups to control access and manage traffic.
    - **VPC: Virtual Private Cloud:** Private cloud environment inside a public cloud
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to enhance availability and fault tolerance.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of instances based on demand, ensuring the application has the necessary resources.

## Key features

- **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, with no long-term commitments.
- **Reserved Instances**: Make a one-time payment for a significant discount on instance usage over a one- or three-year term.
- **Spot Instances**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price, allowing cost savings for flexible workloads.

## Instance Launch Types

- **On Demand Instances:** short workload, predictable pricing
- **Reserved Instances (1 & 3 years):** long workloads
- **Convertible Reserved Instances:** long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plans (1 & 3 years):** commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- **Spot Instances:** short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances
- **Dedicated Instances:** no other customers will share your hardware
- **Dedicated Hosts:** book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Capacity Reservations:** reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

### In-depth Launch Types

**On Demand Instance**

- **Pay for what you use:**
    - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
    - All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- **Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave**

**Reserved Instances**

- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- **You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)**
- **Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)**
- Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
- Convertible Reserved Instance
    - Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
    - Up to 66% discount

**Savings Plans**

- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
- **You have to commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)**
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across:
    - Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
    - OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
    - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

**Spot Instances**

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- **Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price**
- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
- **Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure**
    - Batch jobs
    - Data analysis
    - Image processing
    - Any distributed workloads
    - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

**Dedicated Hosts**

- **A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use**
- Allows you to address compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
    - On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
    - Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- **Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)**
- **Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs**

**Dedicated Instances**

- **Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you**
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

**Capacity Reservations**

- **Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration**
- **Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ**
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not

## EC2 Instance Type Suitability

- **On Demand Instances:**
    - Unpredictable web applications
- **Reserved Instances:**
    - Database servers that require long term activity
- **Savings Plans (1 & 3 years):**
    - SaaS provider with 3 year-minimum steady usage
- **Spot Instances:**
    - For jobs that can be paused and resumed
    - Usually cheapest
- **Dedicated Instances:**
    - Good for strict regulatory requirements and using custom software licenses.
- **Dedicated Hosts:**
    - When hardware isolation is needed from outsiders, but can be shared with other applications from the same AWS account.
- **Capacity Reservations:**
    - Good for ensuring that an application will have the processing capacity in case it’s needed (might not be)
    - Good for when a specific AZ is needed
    - Good for new applications
